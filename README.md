Oh man, just stumbled out of Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning. My brain’s kinda buzzing like a beehive, and my back’s sore from how those seats feel like they were made in medieval times. Can still feel popcorn crumbs on my jeans. Was trying to get them off, ended up making it worse, now there's a whole breadcrumb trail thing happening, like something out of Hansel and Gretel. Honestly, whoops.

The opening scene—BAM! Explosions straight away, that’s how you know you're in for it—Tom Cruise running faster than… I dunno, faster than time, maybe? Seriously, I’ll never get how the man doesn't seem to age, or maybe he just downloads the movie of youth every year and watches himself into being ageless. Meanwhile, there's me creaking like an old barn door when I stand up.

> That part on the train though, when the carriages got all separated and Ethan Hunt’s just hopping between them like he’s played too much Frogger. Almost expect him to whip out a Gameboy there. My heart basically tried to leave my body in protest like a bird trapped in a tiny cage. And the crowd—man, it was like listening to a herd of elephants attempting synchronized swimming, all rustles and whispers, and a baby wailing for good measure.

Simon Pegg was hilarious. Not his lines or anything specific, just his face when the tech glitches and he’s all like, Oops. I've been there, dude. Like when you try to watch the movie on a dodgy WiFi connection, and it buffers at all the crucial bits. Classic.

Every time Ving Rhames spoke, it was like a smooth jazz bass line in between all the chaos. Kinda grounding, you know? So while things exploded and Cruise's hair majestically defied gravity, there was a voice reminding you humans can still be cool cucumbers amid the madness.

My shoes feel sticky from, probably soda? Who brings soda into their orbit when they’re essentially floating through space amidst these high-octane scenes?

There was this super random moment when Ethan and the villain—I swear they were fighting like they were impersonating spaghetti—limbs everywhere, all tangled. Actually, made me a little hungry but also wonder too intensely about the tensile strength of pasta. Who’d win? Impossible questions.

When I turned my phone back on, all the notifications blitzed in like a confused army, but who even cares right now? Mind’s too full of impossible missions and the lingering question: How does one apply to be Tom Cruise?

```python
def mission_impossible(agent):
    if agent == Ethan Hunt:
        execute_plan()
    else:
        self_destruct()
```
